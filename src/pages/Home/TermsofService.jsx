                Weefly operates as a travel intermediary. Our Platform enables

                When you make a Booking through Weefly, you are entering into a
                direct contract with the respective Service Provider. Weefly
                acts solely as the interface between you and the Service
                Provider. Our role is limited to:

                travel dates, contact details) is correct. Weefly is not liable

                successfully processed, you will receive a confirmation email.
                This email serves as acknowledgment of your Booking. The
                contract with the Service Provider is formed only when they
                confirm the Booking. In the rare event that a Booking cannot be
                confirmed by the Service Provider after payment, our sole
                liability will be to refund the amount you paid.
